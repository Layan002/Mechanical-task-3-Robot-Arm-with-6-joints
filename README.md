# About
I've gesigned this complicated robot arm with six degrees of freedom (6 DOF). This is the most comlicated and hard design I've ever created in all my life with solidworks!! I am so proud to achive the final result of this task since it took from me about two weeks to complete üòÉ.

# Parts
- I've created about 26 parts (without taking a count to the parts that I took it as ready-made)!! <br>

## Servos



# Screws 
- I've used 14 built-in screws !!<br>



# Assemblies
- From all the parts I've showd I created two assemblies:
1- Gripper.<br>
2- The lower part of the robot arm.<br>

The "gripper" was a sub-assembly in the "robot arm assembly".


# What I've learnt in SolidWorks ?

In the King Abdulaziz university we built just the basics in the solidworks. But after implementing this task I learnt new solid knowledge! Lets beak them down üòç! I will mention the most importent to less: <br>
- I've learnt how to desing gears.
- learning how to mate two gears or multiple.
- I've learnt How to design comlicated part in the shortest and easiest way (Thinking more as a professional industrial engineer).
- I enhanced more my knowledge in how the servo motors move and how to assemble them with bearings and joints.
