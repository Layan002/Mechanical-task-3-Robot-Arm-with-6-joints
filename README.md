# About
I've designed this complicated robot arm with six degrees of freedom (7 DOF). This is the most comlicated and hard design I've ever created in all my life!! I am so proud to achive the final result of this task since it took from me about two weeks to complete üòÉ.

# Assemblies
I've created two assemblies:

- The whole robot arm.<br>

- Gripper.<br>

>[!NOTE]
>The "gripper" was a sub-assembly in the "robot arm assembly".

# Parts
- I've created about 21 parts (without taking account to the parts that I took it as ready-made e.g. screws and servos) <br>

## Servos
## Types of servos:
I used two types of servos: MX-28AR & XL-320
- MX-28AR:<br>

## Screws 
I've used 14 built-in screws !! You can check them in the files section. 





# What I've learnt in SolidWorks ?

In the King Abdulaziz university we built just the basics in the solidworks. But after implementing this task I learnt new solid knowledge! Lets beak them down üòç! I will mention the most importent to less: <br>
- I've learnt how to desing gears.
- learning how to mate two gears or multiple.
- I've learnt How to design comlicated part in the shortest and easiest way (Thinking more as a professional industrial engineer).
- I enhanced more my knowledge in how the servo motors move and how to assemble them with bearings and joints.
